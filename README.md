Builds a docker image to provide MISP with Microsoft Sentinel integration.

Contains code formerly hosted in MicrosoftGraph "security-api-solutions" repo on GitHub formerly located at https://github.com/microsoftgraph/security-api-solutions.
Repo has since been deleted so code is now hosted directly in this repo.
